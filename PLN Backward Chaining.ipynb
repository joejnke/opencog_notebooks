    "In simple rule-based systems, there are two kinds of inference, [forward chaining](https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Unified_rule_engine#Forward_Chainer) and [backward chaining](https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Unified_rule_engine#Backward_Chainer).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backward chaining :**  given a target, an atom that may or may not contain free variables, the system tries to find an inference tree that proves the target, grounding the free variables if necessary.<br>\n",
    "Because the target determines which rules are selected and used, this method is considered *goal-driven*, in contrast to *data-driven* *forward-chaining* inference. Backward chaining is also considered to be *goal-directed* inference, or *hypothesis driven*, because inferences are not performed until the system is made to prove a particular goal (i.e. a question or target).<br>\n",
    "*Backward Chaining* is used when you want to work backwards from the [Consequent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequent) to the [Antecedent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antecedent_(logic%29). It is usually the part that follows *'then'* in a proposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of antecedents & consequents :**\n",
    "> -  If **_P_**, then **_Q_**.<br>\n",
    "**_Q_** is the consequent of this hypothetical proposition. **_P_** is the antecedent.<br>\n",
    "-  If **_X_** is a mammal, then **_X_** is an animal.<br>\n",

    "**A logical example of Backward Chaining**<br>\n",
    "> Here we will try to satisfy the goal of determining whether 'Plato is mortal' or not.<br>\n",
    "Known facts:<br>\n",
    "> -  Plato is a philosopher.\n",
    "> -  Plato likes to wrestle.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> The goal is to find out whether Plato is mortal based on a rule base : <br>\n",
    "> 1. **If** X is a philosopher and likes to wrestle **then** X is a man.\n",
    "> 2. **If** X can fly and lives in the sky **then** X is a god.\n",
    "> 3. **If** X is a god **then** X is immortal.\n",
    "> 4. **If** X is a man **then** X is mortal. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using backward reasoning we can determine whether Plato is mortal in 4 steps. As we can see from rule 4, that this rule has a consequent of 'X is mortal' matches our goal to find out if 'Plato is mortal', so this checks out. Look at the antecedent to step 4 (the bit just after the If clause) - it is 'X is a man'. So now this antecedent (Substituting X for Plato) becomes the new goal of finding out if 'Plato is a man'.<br> \n",
    "We can see rule 1 contains the consequent 'X is a man', and can see the antecedents are .. 'X is a philosopher', and 'X likes to wrestle'.<br>\n",
    "So now the antecedent(s) are broken down into two subgoals...<br> \n",
    "Given the two facts of 'Plato is a Philosopher' and 'Plato likes to wrestle', we can see that these two subgoals are satisfied.<br> \n",
    "We find rule 1 matches - and find that it is true that the consequent of rule 4 'X is mortal' matches - and therefore Plato is indeed mortal.\n",
