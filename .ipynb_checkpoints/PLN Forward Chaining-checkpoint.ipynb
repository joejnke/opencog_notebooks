    "Forward chaining is one of the two main methods of reasoning when using an inference engine and can be described logically as repeated application of modus ponens... see [Wikipedia for more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_chaining).<br>\n",
    "_Modus Ponens is the rule of logic which states that if a conditional statement (‘if ***P*** then ***Q***’) is accepted, and the antecedent ***P*** holds, then the consequent ***Q*** may be inferred._<br>\n",
    "The inference process of Forward Chaining starts with 3 things:<br>\n",
    "* an Initial source (in our case they are 'initial source' atoms),\n",
    "* knowledge base (the atomspace in OpenCog lingua), and \n",
    "* a set of rules called the rule base.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create new knowledge by selecting and applying appropriate rules matching the source to the knowledge base.<br>\n",
    "The OpenCog forward chainer is implemented as an iterative single step forward chaining process where a new source is selected each time from among potential sources and applied to a predefined set of atoms called the focus set. The termination criteria could be based on some fitness function or a predefined maximum iteration which is the current approach.\n"
