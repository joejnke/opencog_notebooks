    "#  GHOST (General Holistic Organism Scripting Tool)\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "[GHOST](https://github.com/opencog/opencog/tree/master//opencog/ghost) (General Holistic Organism Scripting Tool) is a [DSL](Domain-Specific Language) (Domain-Specific Language) designed to allow human authors to script behaviors for artificial characters. GHOST is inspired by [ChatScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatScript) in its syntax, it uses [ECAN](https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Hands_On_with_Attention_Allocation) to guide the context formation and rule discovery processes, [OpenPsi](https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Hands_On_With_OpenCog#OpenPsi) for internal dynamics modulation and goal-driven rule (action) selection, as well as various other OpenCog cognitive algorithms for handling a wider range of situations in more flexible and intelligent ways. Ghost interpreter is written in [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29) and runs in the OpenCog Scheme shell. Ghost rules are interpreted into [Atoms](https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atom) living in OpenCog’s [Atomspace](https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atomspace) semantic knowledge store, and are executed within OpenCog using the OpenCog Pattern Matcher and Action Selector and associated mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Ghost rule has two required parts, a **pattern** and an **action**; and an optional third part, a **goal** or set of goals. The general semantic is: When the _pattern_ is observed, if the _goal_ is being pursued by the agent, then consider taking the _action_ specified in the rule. If no _goal_ is specified, a generic goal such as _“interact with others”_ is implicitly assumed. A Ghost script consists of a set of rules, which may be grouped into files called **topics**. A _topic_ may have some annotations associated with it, which apply to all the rules in the topic (unless overridden by annotations specific to certain rules.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both patterns and actions may optionally reference Scheme functions. (Support for functions written in other languages may be added in a later version.) An envisioned usage pattern is: Writing Ghost rules and, in coordination with the Ghost rule authoring process, adding new Scheme functions to help the rules do their things.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple Ghost rule is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> s: ( Hi there ) Who said that? \n",
    "\n",
    "> Pattern = someone says *“Hi there”* to the agent. <br>\n",
    "> Action = the agent says *“Who said that?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "another example that include goal and functions :\n",
    "> #goal: (novelty=1)<br>\n",
    "> s: ( Hi there ^no_people_around ) Who said that? ^look_around\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Pattern** = someone says **“Hi there”** to the agent, and there are no people around (i.e. the Scheme function **no_people_around** outputs **True**) <br>\n",
    "**Action** = the agent says **“Who said that?”** and then invokes the Scheme function **look_around**<br>\n",
    "**Goal** = **novelty**. So the agent uses this rule when the **“novelty”** goal is important to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, the Ghost interpreter uses OpenCog’s [Pattern Matcher](https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Pattern_matching) to match the patterns of its rules to content in OpenCog’s Atomspace knowledge store. The specifics of this matching are simple now, but are highly customizable and can be made more sophisticated in future versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "* A GHOST rule is essentially an OpenPsi rule (aka psi-rule), which is an ImplicationLink that can be expressed as\n",
    "```\n",
    "context AND action -> goal\n",
    "```\n",
    "that is if a pattern or context is matched action is then executed and the goal is said to be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A goal also has an ugre to express the level of need to achieve that goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ghost rules are organized into topics. Before parsing any rules, a topic can be set and all subsequent rules created will belong to that topic until another topic is set or the end of the file is reached. If no topic is set, a default topic is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When a GHOST rule is being created, it will firstly be passed to a parser for syntax checking and preliminary interpretation. Any rule that is not syntactically correct or with unsupported features will be rejected at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The parser will then pass the intermediate interpretations (aka terms) to a translator that converts them into OpenCog atoms to be stored in the AtomSpace.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ghost action selector is responsible for selecting a rule that is applicable to a given context. When a textual input is received, rules that satisfy the given context will first be selected as candidates. A full context evaluation will then be done for each of the candidates. Action selector will pick one of them based on their satisfiability and their truth value. Satisfiability of rules are compared based on the following criteria:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * Wether a pattern is matched or not\n",
    "   * The strength of the rule's goal\n",
    "   * The urge of the goal\n",
    "   * Importance of the rule (rules just selected are considered less important)\n",
    "   * Whether a rule is in the current topic (priority is given)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example consider two rules with the same pattern but different goal strength:\n",
    "> guile> (ghost-parse \"#goal: (goal1=0.5) u: (hi) hi there ^keep\")<br>\n",
    "> guile> (ghost-parse \"#goal: (goal1=0.7) u: (hi) hello there ^keep\")<br>\n",
    "> guile> (test-ghost \"hi\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The action selector picks the rule with the higher goal strength.<br>\n",
    "Expected output: \n",
    "> \"hi there\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a rule is selected it will not be considered again for subsequent inputs unless it is specified otherwise via **^keep** function or **keep** topic feature.\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of GHOST rules is modeled heavily on [ChatScript](https://github.com/bwilcox-1234/ChatScript/blob/master/WIKI/ChatScript-Basic-User-Manual.md#rules). However, GHOST uses several ChatScript features for different purposes than they are normally used in ChatScript; and also contains some additional features.<br>\n",
    "**Features that are fully supported in GHOST:**\n",

    "* Label\n",
    "* Goal\n",
    "* Urge\n",
    "* Lemma\n",

At such point being able to declare a list of choices in one place and use them everywhere else becomes convenient. This is the concept set.

If you want the original form, you must precede your reference with an apostrophe. In the above rule, for example, if `'_0` were changed to `_0` the output would be **_I eat egg_**; the canonical form of **_eggs_**, which is **_egg_**, would be used. \n",
