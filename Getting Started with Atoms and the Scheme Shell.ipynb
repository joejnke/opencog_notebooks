    "### Atomspace\n",
    "[*Atomspace*](https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atomspace) is a [Knowledge Representation (KR)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) database and the associated query engine that is used to manipulate the data it stores. Data is stored in the form of [hypergraphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph). A [graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28discrete_mathematics%29) is a collection of [vertices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_%28graph_theory%29) (*nodes*) and [edges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#edge) (*links*), in which each edge connects two vertices. A hypergraph is a graph in which each edge can connect an arbitrary number of vertices. In *Atomspace* the vertices and edges are collectively called [*Atoms*](https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atom). So the *Atomspace* has hypergraphs that are made up of *Atoms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Atoms, Links and Nodes\n",
    "Each *Atom* has a set of properties associated with it. Based on these, *atoms* are classified into *Links* and *Nodes*.\n",

    "**_Nodes_**: These are uniquely identified by the combination of **name** and **type**. So no two *Nodes* in an *Atomspace* can have both the same **name** and the same **type**. These kinds of *atoms* correspond to the vertices in the hypergraph.\n",
